</blockquote>
<p>The q tag <q>defines a short quotation</q> and is put in quotation marks</p>
<p>
the abbreviation tag can be used like in <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
along with a tooltip, this helps search engines and translators
</p>
<p>the address element can be used for email address, URL, locations, phone number etc.</p>
<address>
Rakkah<br>
14th street<br>
1425

by Edvard Munch, these are in italics</p>
<p>bi-directional overide can be used to write lines from right to left, like for arabic?</p>
<bdo dir="rtl">shanta taht atawila</bdo>

<hr>
<h1 id="5">Colours</h1>
<p>colours can be used in fonts, backgrounds and borders</p>
<p>colours can be specified through name, but also RGB(A), HSL(A) and HEX values</p>
<p>grey shades can be made in HTML by using equal values for all fields</p>
<p>HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="6">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
<p>used to format the layout of a page, can control color, font, size, positioning, images and more</p>
<p>can be used inline, interally or externally</p>
<h2>Inline</h2>
<p>this is when the style <i>attribute</i> is used inside an <i>HTML element</i>;
used to apply a unique style to a single element</p>
<h2>Internal</h2>
<p>this is when a style <i>element</i> is used in the <i>head section</i>;
used to define a style for a single HTML page</p>
<h2>External</h2>
<p>this is when a <i>link element</i> is used in the <i>head section</i> to link to an external CSS file; 
used to define a style for many HTML pages</p>

<hr>
<h1 id="7">Links</h1>
<p>hyperlinks are created using the 'a' tag, with an href attribute, and optionally a target attribute</p>
<p>can have the target _self (open in the same tab), _blank (open in a new tab),
and _parent and _top (which aren't really used anymore)</p>
<p>Also, there are absolute URLs, which has a full web address with the https://www part, and relative URLs which 
link to a page within the same website</p>
<p>You can have an image act as a link too by putting the 'img' tag inside the 'a' tag, additionally
you can add a tooltip for an even better effect.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/Ibyst/Ibyst" target="_blank" title="github">
    <img src="githublogo.png" alt="github logo" style="width:100px; height:100px;">
</a>
<p>You can add 'mailto:' inside the href attribute to have the link open the user's email program</p>
<a href="mailto:ibaadm2007@gmail.com">email me here</a>
<p>links can be made as buttons using JS (not shown here) or through CSS by using background colours and padding, 
although to make the link look different when previously clicked/hovered/active inline CSS can't be used</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_colors.asp" target="_blank"
style="border:2px solid black; background-color:black;color:white; padding:10px; text-decoration:none;">example</a>
<p>you can add bookmarks to titles by using the 'id' attribute and then you can add links to these bookmarks,
even if they're on a different page</p>
<a href="#1">Jump to the top</a>

<hr>
<h1 id="8">Images</h1>
<p>Images use the 'img' tag and have no end tag. They can use absolute or relative URLs.
Images can be used as links. Images can also be gifs. Loading large images takes time and may slow down your website</p>
<p>Image tags can have sizes determined by either the width and height attributes, or the style attribute,
however, using the style attribute is recommended as it will not get overwritten by internal/external CSS</p>
<p> <img src="githublogo.png" alt="floating github logo" style="float:right;width:50px;height:50px;">
You can make an image float to the right or the left of text by using the style attribute 'float'</p>

<h2>Image Maps</h2>
<p>Image maps can be used to define regions on an image and perform an action when these images are clicked
To create an image map, first define an image as normal but add a 'usemap' attribute. Then, separately, add a
map attribute, and in this add area attributes, defining the 'shape', 'coords', 'href' and/or any JS functions.
The shape can be either rect, circle, poly, or default (whole image), and the coords are in pixels.</p>
<p>Click one of the numbers to go to that respective topic on this page</p>
<img src="1234.png" alt="1234" usemap="#1234map">
<map name="1234map">
    <area shape="rect" coords="26, 26, 98, 98" href="#1">
    <area shape="rect" coords="125, 26, 197, 98" href="#2">
    <area shape="rect" coords="26, 125, 98, 197" href="#3">
    <area shape="rect" coords="125, 125, 197, 197" href="#4">
</map>

<h2>Background Images</h2>
<p style="background-image:url(white.jpg); background-repeat:no-repeat; background-attachment:fixed; background-size:cover;">
You can add an image for the background of the page or of text using the style attribute
By default, the image repeats itself to fill the sceen, but this can be modified to stretch to fit the screen,
either with a fixed aspect ratio or stretched.</p>

<h2>Picture Element</h2>
<p>The picture element can be used to add a bit more specificity when adding images. It can have multiple
'source' elements with different criteria so that it displays the first image that has the criteria met, kind of
like a CASE OF statement in pseudocode. The criteria can include different minimum sizes for the display or to
improve access speeds or the image file type and if the browser supports it.</p>
<p>This image changes when the display size changes</p>
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width:1100px)" srcset="githublogo.png">
    <source media="(min-width:700px)" srcset="1234.png">
    <img src="white.jpg">
</picture>

<h1 id="9">Tables</h1>
<p>Tables can be made by adding multiple 'td' elements (table data) in multiple 'tr' elements (table row)
in a 'table' element. A 'th' element can be used in a row to define table headers, which are bold and centred
but this can be changed through CSS, along with borders and other things. A caption can be added using the
'caption' element and its style can be modified</p>

<p>Properties 'border-collapse' and 'border-radius' can be modified to have single/rounded borders. Borders can
be solid, but also dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset and none/hidden. This, along with the
colour, can be set in the 'border' property, but can also be their own 'border-color' and 'border-style'
property, which has higher priority.</p>

<p>To modify the width of  a table, you can add the style attribute to it and change the width. Also, you can
add the style attribute and change the width of a 'th' or the height of a 'tr'. Measurements are in % screen or
px</p>

<p>You can addjust the padding inside cells and the spacing between cells. You can merge cells using colspan
and rowspan, where the content of the cell that is merged remains undefined.</p>

<p>You can create a zebra effect using the :nth-child() selector, putting it on 'td'/'th' makes it vertical and
putting it on 'tr' makes it horizontal. You can overlap the zebra effect if you use a translucent colour. If
you use 'border-bottom' on 'tr's instead of having a border around the whole table, you can have a horizontal
dividers. If you use the ':hover' selector on 'tr's, you can have the row highlighted upon hovering.</p>

<p>you can specify colgroups to have columns styled a certain way, although only the width, visibilty, background
and border can be changed. These must be placed right after the 'table' element, or right after the 'caption'
element if it is present.</p>

<!--using colspan and rowspan-->
<table style="width:100%;">
    <caption style="font-size:30px; padding-bottom:5px;">Country sizes</caption>
    <colgroup>
        <col span="1" style="background-color: honeydew;"><!--I just simulated the effects of the colgroup-->
        <col span="3">
        <col span="1" style="background-color: honeydew;"><!--because the external CSS overwrites it ?-->
    </colgroup>
    <tr style="height:45px; background-color:black;">
        <th style="background-color: honeydew; border-radius: 0;">.</th>
        <th colspan="2">Location</th>

<h1>Lists</h1>
<p>Lists can be unordered/bulleted ('ul'), ordered/numbered ('ol') or descriptive('dl'). Lists can be nested. An
unordered list can have a disc, circle, square or none as its item marker. An ordered list can use numbers,
capital/lowercase letters, or capital/lowercase roman numerals, and it can start counting from any number</p> 

<dl>
    <dt>England</dt>
    <dd>London</dd>
    <dd>Small</dd>
    <dt>Pakistan</dt>
    <dd>Islamabad</dd>
    <dd>Medium</dd>
    <dt>Saudi Arabia</dt>
    <dd>Riyadh</dd>
    <dd>Large</dd>
</dl>

<ol type="I" start="10">
    <li>England</li>
    <li>Pakistan</li>
    <li>Saudi Arabia</li>
</ol>

<p>A list can be made horizontal: paired with some styling, this can be used to create a navigation menu.</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Home</p></li>
    <li><p>About</p></li>
    <li><p>Games</p></li>
    <li><p>Contact</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Display Values, Div and Span</h1>
<p>Every element has a default display value, most commonly either block or inline.</p>
<p>Block-level elements always start on a new line, has some space (margin) before and after the element, and 
takes up the full width available. Examples include: blockquotes, h1-6, horiontal rules, lists, div and p.</p>
<p>Inline elements do not start on new lines and only take the width it needs. Examples include: a, q, button, 
img and span.</p>
<p>The div element is used as a containter for other HTML elements and commonly uses the attributes style,
class and id. It can group sections and with CSS, it can be used to style blocks of content. Div is a block-level
element, by default, it will take up the full width available. However, if the content doesn't take up the full
width, you can specify the width then set the margin to auto. You can have div elements side by side on a page in 
a few ways, like using float, inline-block and grid, but flex is the best way from my research for simplicity</p>
<div class="Countries">
    <div style="background-color: #C0CCCC;">
        <h2>England</h2>
        <p>Its capital is London</p>
        <p>It is a small country</p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #CCC0CC;">
        <h2>Pakistan</h2>
        <p>Its capital is Islamabad</p>
        <p>It is a medium country</p>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: #CCCCC0;">
        <h2>Saudi Arabia</h2>
        <p>Its capital is Riyadh</p>
        <p>It is a large country</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Span is similar to div in the way that it is used; it can be wrapped around a piece of text as an inline
container and styles can then be applied to the <span style="background-color: blue; color:white">selected
text.</span></p>

<hr>
<h1>Classes and IDs</h1>
<p>Classes are used to specify certain parts of a document to be used by CSS and JS. Classes can be used for
many HTML elements, and one element can have many classes (by having a space in between them). Classes are
referenced using a dot before the name. IDs are similar to classes, but only one element can have a certain ID
and, when referenced, a # is used before the name. Names are case sensitive to classes and IDs.</p>
