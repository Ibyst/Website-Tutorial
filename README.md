This project was started in order for me to learn how to build a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and JS.
I am also learning how to use git and github as this is the first project im working on using these tools.

31/05/24 - Today, I pretty much just relearnt the basics of HTML, using headers, paragraphs, images, links, some basic styles etc.

1/06/24 - Learnt a bit more of VS code, especially its compatability with git and github. Also learnt a bit more of HTML, like text formatting and quoting and citing, although currently im not sure if I will use so much of these elements

2/06/24 - just learnt more HTML, including colours and links, but most importantly more CSS and have now created a separate .css file

4/06/24 - missed one day, but anyways, now learnt more indepth about links and images

5/06/24 - learnt about tables in HTML

7/06/24 - missed a day again, learnt about lists, display values and div.

8/06/24 - just did a little bit on classes and IDs, excited for the upcoming chapters

9/06/24 - learnt about iframes and javascript

11/06/24 - technically did a bit of today's work yesterday, but worked on layout and semantics, responsive web design and computercode.

12/06/24 - finished the HTML tutorial section on w3schools with HTML etiquette and entities, and added an interactive table of contents as the page was getting quite long. I'm planning on starting CSS, possibly JS, tomorrow as I feel like I know most of the HTML I would need to make a 'portfolio' website.
